# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Project Overview

AutosRUs is suffering from production troubles concerning their automobile prototype, MechaCar. Upper management is looking for analysis to review production data that involves the following:

- Linear regression analysis to indentify which variables in the dataset predict mpg of the protypes
- Summary statistics on the PSI of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- T-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically differerent from the mean population
- A new statistical study to compare performance against vehicles from other manufacturers

## Resources

- Data: MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_Coil.csv
- Software: R Studio 2022.02.3 Build 492
